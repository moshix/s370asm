S370Asm assembler by Jim Salvino with some changes by me
=======================================================

Jim Salvino created an amazing yet surprisingly simple S/370 assembler in Python3. 

Once he announced it, I immediately started playing with it. We found a few small issues which Jim fixed immediately. 

then I added some very small mods to the assembler and created a simple report writer from my youtube videos and here is the repo. 

Great learning tool. Thank you Jim!
